In order to display repeater field values nested inside of a group field with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), you will need to loop over the group field AND the repeater field.

```php
// group loop
if( have_rows('group_field_name') ):
  while ( have_rows('group_field_name') ) : the_row();

    // repeater loop
    if( have_rows('repeater_field_name') ):
      while ( have_rows('repeater_field_name') ) : the_row();

        // repeater sub field
        echo get_sub_field('repeater_sub_field_name');

      endwhile;
    endif;

  endwhile;
endif;
```
