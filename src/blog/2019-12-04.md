Before you go all crazy throwing together a quick JavaScript snippet for adding an active class name to the links in your navigation, take a moment to look further into the [Gatsby Link API](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-link/).

```jsx
<Link to="/about/" activeClassName="is-active">
  About Me
</Link>
```

It's really that simple.

Alternatively you can use `activeStyle` which is just a style object that is applied when the current link is active.

You're also able to use `partiallyActive`, which allows you to partally match the current URL. e.g. `/blog/funky-post-name/`
